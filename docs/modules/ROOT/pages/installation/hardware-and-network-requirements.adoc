There are minimum node hardware and network requirements necessary for installation and testing of the Fawkes system.

== Hardware requirements

The Fawkes hypervisor have the following requirements and recommendations for installation and testing.

=== Hypervisor Node Requirements

Hypervisor nodes are home to virtual machines, these require hardware-assisted virtualization and will be home to
the management and Kubernetes VMs.

|Type |Requirements and Recommendations

|CPU
|x86_64.footnote:support[aarch64 artifacts are not built at this time for hypervisors.] Hardware-assisted virtualization is required.
8-core processor minimum for testing; 16-core
or above is recommended for production.

|Memory
|8 GB minimum for testing; 32 GB or above recommended for production

|Disk Capacity
|100 GB minimum for testing; 1 TB or above recommended for production

|Disk Quantity
|1 for testing; 3 or more recommended for production, 2 of which will be used for OS redundancy. The third disk should be larger
than 1.5 TB for ephemeral, virtual machine storage.

|Disk Performance
|5,000+ random IOPS per disk(SSD/NVMe). Management nodes (first 3 nodes) must be link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/using-fio-to-tell-whether-your-storage-is-fast-enough-for-etcd[fast enough for Etcd].

|Network Card
|1 Gbps Ethernet minimum for testing, at least two 25 Gbps Ethernet for production

|Network Switch
|Trunking of ports required for VLAN support (IEEE 802.1Q tagging)

=== Storage Node Requirements

Storage nodes play a pivotal role in the deployment of an HPC cluster. These nodes are not deployed as hypervisors and
do not run any virtualization services other than link:https://podman.io/[Podman].

The current storage solution of choice is link:https://ceph.io/en/[CEPH].

|Disk Capacity
|100 GB minimum for testing; 4 TB or above recommended for production

|Disk Quantity

storage solution.

|Network Card
|1 Gbps Ethernet minimum for testing, at least *four* 25 Gbps Ethernet for production
