  # In order for a version be classified as a prerelease, the component must also have at least one non-prerelease
  # version. If a component only has prerelease versions, the latest version is not classified as a prerelease even
  # if the prerelease key is set in the component descriptor. When a component only has prerelease versions, then the
  # value of the latest_version_segment is used instead. This behavior may change in the future.
